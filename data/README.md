This folder contains the two benchmarks we curated or re-splitted.
 (1) tldr
 (2) conala

On each dataset, we provide 
 (1) nl intent (entry 'nl')
 (2) oracle code (entry 'cmd') 
    * bash for tldr
    * python for conala
 (3) oracle docs (entry 'oracle_man') 
    * In the data files, we only provide the manual ids, their contents could be found in the docs.json file in each dataset
